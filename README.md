# Growin x Yapily - Frontend Engineer Coding Challenge
### André Gonçalves

## Deployed Version
```
For an easier check of the app you can visit

https://marvel-characters-challenge.herokuapp.com/#/
```

## Project setup
```
Unzip the code
Open a terminal
Navigate to the project folder
On the terminal run "npm install" (this will install the dependencies)
On the terminal run "npm run serve" (this will start the code)
Open the browser and navigate to "localhost:8080"
You should be watching the app now
```

## NOTES
```
node version used 14.17.0
node version 18+ will probably not build

The app needs a marvel developer key to actually fetch the information, you can add one
by going to "src/network/client" and adding your apiKey there (there is a comment in the code telling you where)
```
